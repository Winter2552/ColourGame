Hello and Welcome to the Colour Game Repository
Here we have all the assets and game files you need to work on the game.


Procedures
1 - Check with the other members if they are working on any github saved files, if they are make a new save branch, and name it after yourself and what you changed.
2 - The Change Files will be crossed examined then merged by Raven
3 - When creating Assets add them to the asset WIP Folder, until they can be finalised in the next commit, and be moved over into the ASSETS folder.
4 - Notify Members of your commit before you upload
